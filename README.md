# -FM-Radio-Transmitter-Project
This project is for FM TxR (Emitter) for broadcasting audio on 100.9 FM but is homemade prototype where we used local materials and electronic components.
# FM Radio Transmitter Project

## Overview
This project involves building a functional FM radio transmitter from scratch. It demonstrates my understanding of frequency modulation, circuit design, and signal processing.

## Features
- Transmits audio signals over FM frequencies.
- Adjustable frequency range.
- Compact and portable design.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Components**: Oscillator, capacitors, resistors, antenna.
- **Tools**: Soldering iron, multimeter.
- **Software**: KiCad (for circuit design).

## How It Works
The transmitter modulates an audio signal onto a carrier wave, which is then broadcasted over a specific FM frequency. The receiver (any FM radio) can tune into this frequency to hear the audio.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge**: Signal interference.
- **Solution**: Improved shielding and optimized antenna placement.
